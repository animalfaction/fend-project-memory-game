## Instructions

This is my version of Udacity's memory game project, in which the student converts a static mockup of a memory/card flip game into an interactive one. This requires modifying the HTML and CSS files provided, but primarily the JavaScript file. 

The original project starting files can be found at [https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).

## Contributing

This repository is my own implementation of the Udacity course assignment, so I most likely won't be accepting any pull requests.
